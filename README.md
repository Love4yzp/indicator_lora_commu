# Baisc communication demo between SenseCAP Indicator and XIAO (Via Wio-E5)

## Description
This demo will show you how to use SenseCAP Indicator to get sensor data from XIAO via Wio-E5.

this projection has made a simple frame between two device to communicate with each other. The XIAO will send the sensor data(Payload) to Wio-E5, and Wio-E5 will forward the Payload to SenseCAP Indicator. The SenseCAP Indicator will phrase the payload and show the data on the screen.
